"""V2 domain invariants: Exchange-First consistency checks.

These functions assert that the Exchange-First invariants hold.
They must be called before any state mutation and before claiming
that a position is managed.

Invariants that MUST hold:
1. A MANAGED position requires a FillReceipt with exchange_order_id + trade_ids
2. POSITION_PROJECTED cannot exist without a FillReceipt
3. A PROTECTION_ACTIVE position must have exchange conditional order IDs
4. INTENT_CREATED -> FILLED transition is illegal (must pass through ACKNOWLEDGED)
5. Local position quantity cannot exceed fill receipt filled_quantity
6. Protection prices must be computed from fill_receipt.average_fill_price
