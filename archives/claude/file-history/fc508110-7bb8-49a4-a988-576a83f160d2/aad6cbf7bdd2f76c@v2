"""V2 domain receipts: immutable exchange evidence records.

Receipts are the Exchange-First proof that exchange actions occurred.
They are immutable once created and serve as the source of truth for
local state projection.

Invariants:
- FillReceipt requires exchange_order_id + trade_ids + positive quantity/price
- ProtectionReceipt requires exchange conditional order IDs
- ReduceReceipt requires exchange_order_id + trade_ids
