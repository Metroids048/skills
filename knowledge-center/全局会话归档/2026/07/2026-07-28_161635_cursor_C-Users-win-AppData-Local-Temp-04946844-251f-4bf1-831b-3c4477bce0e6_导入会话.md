## 角色区分

### unknown

The official Figma MCP server. Use this server whenever the user wants to create, generate, edit, implement, or sync any design, UI, screen, component, mockup, or visual — in Figma, FigJam, Figma Make, or Figma Slides — and whenever the user mentions Figma or provides a figma.com URL.

This server bridges code and design in both directions, and supports designing from scratch using existing design systems and codebases.

CAPABILITIES:
- Read designs FROM Figma into code (get_design_context, get_screenshot, get_metadata, get_figjam)
- Write designs INTO Figma from code, intent, or existing components (use_figma, generate_figma_design, create_new_file, upload_assets)
- Bridge code and design via Code Connect (get_code_connect_map, add_code_connect_map, list_code_components, get_code_component_info)
- Create diagrams and FigJam content (generate_diagram, get_figjam)

WHEN TO USE THESE TOOLS:
- The user wants to create, mock up, or generate any UI, screen, component, or design — even if Figma isn't named
- The user wants to implement a design as code (design-to-code)
- The user wants to push a page, view, or component into Figma (code-to-design)
- The user wants to update, sync, or edit an existing Figma file
- The user shares a figma.com URL
- The user wants to build or extend a design system, design tokens, or component library
- The user wants to create a diagram in FigJam

SKILLS (Prefer the skills shipped with the Figma plugin on the agent being used. If no Figma plugin is installed, use the skills served by the Figma MCP resource):
- /figma-use — MANDATORY before calling use_figma; fallback: skill://figma/figma-use/SKILL.md
- /figma-generate-design — for translating an app page or layout into Figma; fallback: skill://figma/figma-generate-design/SKILL.md
- /figma-generate-library — for building a design system in Figma from code; fallback: skill://figma/figma-generate-library/SKILL.md
- /figma-code-connect — for mapping Figma components to codebase components; fall
