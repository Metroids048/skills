The user wants commit context for: $ARGUMENTS

Run `git blame` (or `git log -L`) on the target file, function, or line in $ARGUMENTS to extract the most recent commit SHA that touched it. Use `git blame -L <start>,<end> <file>` when a line range is given, `git log -L :<function>:<file>` when a function name is given, and `git log -n 1 -- <file>` when only a path is given.

With the SHA in hand, look up the linked agent session via the `memory_commit_lookup` MCP tool with `sha: "<full-sha>"`. If the MCP tool is unavailable, fall back to HTTP: `GET $AGENTMEMORY_URL/agentmemory/session/by-commit?sha=<sha>` with `Authorization: Bearer $AGENTMEMORY_SECRET` when the secret is set.

Present the result as:
- The commit SHA, short SHA, branch, author, message
- The linked session(s): id, project, started/ended timestamps, observation count, summary if any
- A short list of the most important observations from that session (importance >= 7) when available via `memory_recall`

Do not fabricate intent. If the commit has no linked session, say so plainly and surface only what `git show` reveals. If `memory_commit_lookup` returns an empty `commit: null` body, that means the commit predates session linking — do not invent a session.
