# Claude Code additions

- Use `/context` when instruction loading is uncertain.
- Use project Skills for repeatable multi-step procedures instead of expanding this file.
- For substantial changes, delegate final review to the `code-reviewer` subagent in a fresh context.
- Treat CLAUDE.md and auto memory as guidance, not enforcement. Mandatory checks must be implemented through tests, CI, permissions, or Hooks.
- Auto memory may store stable project discoveries such as real commands, architecture decisions, recurring failure patterns, and proven debugging insights. It must not store secrets, temporary task details, unverified guesses, or user-sensitive information.
